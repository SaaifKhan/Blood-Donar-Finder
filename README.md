Blood Donar Finder is 100% open source and free forever!!

We like to challenge the quality of what we build to make it better. To do so, we try to make the product intuitive, beautiful, and user friendly. Innovation and hard work help to fulfill these requirements. I believe in order to innovate we need to think differently. A few months ago I discovered there was no open source free Blood Donating App  that met my quality standards. I happen to know a bit of programming so I decided to make one. I also believe that working with more people can push the standard higher than working alone. So I decided to make it open source and free.
It can be used as Semester Project for students! as students have alot of problems in Semester Projects so its free and 100% woring!!
